# Integrated operator workspace

The implementation is developed on `feat/operator-workspace`, draft PR #24.
It must not be merged automatically. The original `feat/cmdb-assets` working
directory contains unfinished CMDB work, which is preserved and may be reused
in this isolated worktree with the user's authorization.

## Verified architecture and baseline

The application is a Go/MySQL modular monolith with Redis-backed sessions and
ephemeral signals, React/TypeScript, durable outbox deliveries, jobs, a worker
and scheduler. Work records provide numbering, assignments, communication,
attachments, activity and operation reservations. Domain commands use
transactions and optimistic versions; identifiers and versions are JSON strings.

Incidents have domain transitions, assignment, public replies, private notes,
files, history, watchers, relations, batch commands and incident SLA. SLA has
calendars and durable recalculation. Notification delivery and optional SMTP
are persisted. Catalog requests have REQ/RITM/SCTASK and manual fulfillment.
Published workflow definitions are versioned and executions pinned; participant
membership and decisions are checked by the server. User, tenant, RBAC and
session protections are existing foundations to retain.

Main at the start of this task has migrations 1–71. It has no production CMDB,
Problem or Change module. PR #23 contains a separate unfinished CMDB/asset
implementation. CMDB requires typed database and business-service classes,
support groups, lifecycle, additional relations and a complete user interface.
Assets and CI are separate concepts. Existing workflow is coupled to catalog
requests; Change requires an explicit adapter, not a second approval engine.

Existing record lists use independent markup and simple domain-specific filters.
There is no shared column configuration, validated nested filter editor or
group-shared saved view. Existing incident batch commands already check each
object and version and should be reused. Forms already retain drafts on version
conflicts and have navigation guards. Communication keeps independent public
and private drafts. These protections must survive workspace integration.

## Workspace behavior

The existing AppShell now contains compact global controls, permission-scoped
module navigation, record tabs, breadcrumbs and a collapsible context panel.
Tabs are deduplicated by domain URL and registered only after an authorized read.
Session metadata is bounded, held in memory, and discarded on logout or a change
of tenant/user. Known record access is rechecked when the session refreshes.
Internal notes and form drafts are never stored in workspace metadata or browser
storage. Scroll restoration is scoped to the tenant/user and cleared on logout.

Queue counts and rows share each domain's access predicate before pagination.
Counts are decimal strings and links use corresponding filters. Incident SLA risk
means an active incident with a recorded warning/breach on an active or paused
SLA instance; this is the latest persisted worker state, not a prediction.
Approvals count only current, pending decisions before their deadline.

Global search applies object access before returning metadata. It searches only
record numbers and permitted titles, excludes communication and submitted form
values, prioritizes exact numbers, and returns at most ten results of each type.
Input is bounded and wildcard characters are escaped for SQL LIKE.

## Remaining implementation

1. Complete common record lists, saved private/group views, validated nested
   filters, server grouping, safe export and reusable record presentation.
2. Integrate and finish CMDB, incident links and bounded dependency graph.
3. Deliver Problem lifecycle, tasks, communication, links and Known Error.
4. Deliver Change domain adapter, version-bound approval, tasks, controlled
   lifecycle, templates, conflict-safe scheduling and time-window policies.
5. Extend authorized search/context, add operational reports and execute the
   complete ITSM scenario and installer/runtime/regression checks.

This document describes implemented workspace foundations and remaining work;
it does not claim that stages B–F or the complete acceptance scenario are done.
